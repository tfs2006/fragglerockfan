                <p class="intro-text">Fraggle Rock isn't just a place—it's an entire ecosystem where three distinct civilizations coexist, each unaware of their complete dependence on the others. The Fraggles live in the Rock itself, the tiny Doozers build constantly within it, and the giant Gorgs tend their garden above it. Beyond the garden lies Outer Space, the human world that connects to the Rock through a mysterious hole in Doc's workshop.</p>
                <p class="intro-text">This ingenious design wasn't accidental. Jim Henson created this multilayered universe as a metaphor for Earth itself—showing how all beings are interconnected through invisible threads of dependency, whether they realize it or not.</p>

                    <h3>🎵 Music Is Power</h3>
                    <p>Music isn't just entertainment in Fraggle Rock—it has real power. The right song can open secret passages, calm dangerous creatures, heal sickness, and even influence the structure of the Rock itself. This isn't metaphorical; music literally shapes reality here.</p>

                    <h3>🌈 Everything Is Connected</h3>
                    <p>The ecosystem's perfect balance isn't coincidence—it's fundamental to how this universe works. Disrupting one element affects all others immediately and dramatically. When Fraggles stop eating Doozer constructions, Doozers stop building. When Gorgs neglect their garden, the entire system suffers.</p>

                    <h3>✨ Cave Physics Are Different</h3>
                    <p>Objects fall more slowly in certain caverns. Some tunnels allow Fraggles to move faster than they should. Certain crystals can levitate small objects. The Rock doesn't quite follow normal physical laws—it has its own rules.</p>

                    <h3>🕐 Time Flows Strangely</h3>
                    <p>Time in Fraggle Rock doesn't always match time in Outer Space. An hour there might feel like three hours in the Rock, or vice versa. Fraggles who visit Outer Space notice this disconnect immediately.</p>

                    <h3>💚 Intentions Matter</h3>
                    <p>The Rock seems to respond to the intentions of its inhabitants. Those with good hearts find helpful paths opening. Those with selfish intentions often get lost or face obstacles. The Rock itself might have a sense of morality.</p>

                    <h3>🔄 The Cycle Must Continue</h3>
                    <p>The radish cycle is sacred and unbreakable. Any attempt to disrupt it (Gorgs refusing to garden, Fraggles going vegetarian, Doozers stopping construction) causes immediate negative consequences for all species. The system must flow.</p>

                <p>Fraggle Rock is more than a children's show setting—it's a fully realized world with its own ecology, physics, and profound meaning. Jim Henson created a universe that teaches us about interconnection, cooperation, and the invisible threads that bind all living things.</p>
