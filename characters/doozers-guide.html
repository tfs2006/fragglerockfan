                    <h2>What Are Doozers?</h2>
                    <p>Doozers are tiny, industrious, green-skinned creatures who share <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a> with the Fraggles. Standing only about six inches tall (roughly knee-high to a Fraggle), Doozers have built an entire civilization devoted to one primary purpose: <strong>building</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike the carefree, music-loving Fraggles, Doozers are defined by their work ethic. Their famous motto, <em>"A Doozer's work is never done,"</em> reflects their belief that life's meaning comes from constant productive labor. They construct elaborate towers, bridges, and structures from crystallized radish sticks—creations that Fraggles promptly eat.</p>
                    
                    <p>This might seem like a recipe for conflict, but the Doozer-Fraggle relationship is actually a perfect symbiosis. Doozers NEED Fraggles to eat their constructions; otherwise, they'd run out of building space. And the radish stick structures are delicious and nutritious for Fraggles. It's a win-win that neither species fully appreciates until they're forced to think about it.</p>

                <section class="content-section" id="physical-characteristics">
                    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>Doozers have a distinctive appearance that sets them apart from other denizens of Fraggle Rock:</p>
                    
                    <div class="characteristics-grid">
                        <div class="char-card">
                            <h4><i class="fas fa-ruler-vertical"></i> Size</h4>
                            <p>At roughly six inches tall, Doozers are tiny compared to Fraggles (who are already small by human standards). This size difference creates dramatic scale contrasts in the show.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="char-card">
                            <h4><i class="fas fa-palette"></i> Skin Color</h4>
                            <p>All Doozers have green skin, ranging from lime to olive tones. This gives them a uniform appearance that emphasizes their collective identity.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="char-card">
                            <h4><i class="fas fa-hard-hat"></i> Attire</h4>
                            <p>Doozers wear work gear including helmets (hard hats), goggles, and tool belts. Their clothing is functional rather than decorative.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="char-card">
                            <h4><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Body Type</h4>
                            <p>Doozers have humanoid bodies with large heads relative to their size. Their proportions are designed for construction work.</p>
                        </div>

                    <h3>Puppet Design</h3>
                    <p>From a production standpoint, Doozer puppets presented unique challenges. Their small size meant they needed to be filmed separately and composited with Fraggle scenes, or shot using forced perspective. Key Doozer characters like <a href="cotterpin-doozer.html">Cotterpin</a> were given more detailed, expressive puppet designs than background Doozers.</p>

                    <h2>The Doozer Philosophy</h2>

                    <div class="philosophy-highlight">
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> "A Doozer's Work is Never Done"</h3>
                        <p>This motto isn't a complaint—it's a celebration. Doozers find joy, purpose, and identity through constant productive work. They don't build to accumulate; they build because building IS living.</p>
                    </div>

                            <p>Doozers believe that meaningful work provides life's purpose. Idle Doozers are unhappy Doozers.</p>

                    <h3>The Zen of Doozer Work</h3>
                    <p>There's something almost meditative about the Doozer approach. They've achieved what many humans seek: complete alignment between daily activity and life purpose. When Fraggles eat a tower that took weeks to build, Doozers don't despair—they celebrate the space to build again.</p>
                    
                    <p>This philosophy challenges viewers to think about work, meaning, and attachment. Are we too focused on permanent results? Could we find more joy in the process itself?</p>

                    <h3>Location</h3>
                    <p>Located within the cave system of <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>, the Doozer Dome is a protected space where Doozers live, work, and gather. It's connected to the larger cave network but designed for Doozer-scale inhabitants.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Structure</h3>
                    <p>The Dome itself is an impressive feat of Doozer engineering—a permanent structure (unlike the temporary constructions Fraggles eat) that houses:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Residential Areas:</strong> Where Doozer families like <a href="cotterpin-doozer.html">Cotterpin's</a> live</li>
                        <li><strong>Work Facilities:</strong> Radish processing and construction staging areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Spaces:</strong> Gathering areas for Doozer society</li>
                        <li><strong>The Architect's Office:</strong> Where designs are created</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Protected Space</h3>
                    <p>Interestingly, Fraggles generally don't eat the Doozer Dome itself—there seems to be an unspoken understanding that this is Doozer "home base." This suggests more awareness in the Fraggle-Doozer relationship than either species typically acknowledges.</p>

                    <p>The relationship between Doozers and Fraggles is one of the most fascinating aspects of <em>Fraggle Rock</em>:</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Surface Conflict</h3>
                    <p>On the surface, Doozers and Fraggles seem like natural enemies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Doozers build elaborate structures with great care</li>
                        <li>Fraggles casually eat those structures as snacks</li>

                            <p>Without Fraggles eating their constructions, Doozers would fill up all available space and have nothing left to build. They'd be MISERABLE. The episode where Fraggles stop eating Doozer constructions reveals this dramatically.</p>

Their unlikely connection embodies the show's message about understanding between different peoples.</p>

                    <h2>Doozer Technology</h2>
                    <p>Despite their small size, Doozers have developed impressive technology:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Construction Equipment</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Doozer Vehicles:</strong> Small construction vehicles for transporting materials</li>

                        <h3>Why do Doozers keep building if Fraggles eat everything?</h3>
                        <p>Doozers find meaning in the ACT of building, not in permanent results. They actually NEED Fraggles to eat their work—otherwise they'd run out of space. When Fraggles temporarily stop eating Doozer constructions, the Doozers become deeply unhappy.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What are Doozer constructions made of?</h3>
                        <p>Doozer constructions are made from crystallized radish sticks—processed radishes from the Gorgs' garden transformed into translucent, structural building material that's also delicious to Fraggles.</p>

                        <h3>How tall are Doozers?</h3>
                        <p>Doozers are approximately six inches (15 cm) tall—roughly knee-high to a Fraggle. This makes them tiny even by Fraggle standards.</p>

                        <h3>What is the Doozer Dome?</h3>
                        <p>The Doozer Dome is the central Doozer habitat within Fraggle Rock. Unlike the temporary constructions Fraggles eat, the Dome is a permanent structure housing Doozer homes, work facilities, and community spaces.</p>
