                        <h2>Who is Gobo Fraggle?</h2>
                        <p>Gobo Fraggle is the brave, adventurous heart of <a href="../characters.html">the Fraggle Five</a> and serves as the natural leader of the main group in Jim Henson's beloved series <em>Fraggle Rock</em> (1983-1987). Named for his curiosity and "go-go" attitude toward exploration, Gobo is defined by his courage, confidence, and unshakeable desire to discover new places within the vast <a href="../universe.html">caverns of Fraggle Rock</a>.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the nephew of the legendary <a href="uncle-traveling-matt.html">Uncle Traveling Matt</a>, Gobo inherited his uncle's wanderlust and sense of adventure. His regular trips to "Outer Space" (the human world) to retrieve Uncle Matt's postcards make him the bravest Fraggle in the Rock—willing to face the terrifying <a href="sprocket.html">Sprocket</a> and the unknown dangers of <a href="doc.html">Doc's</a> workshop.</p>

                        <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
                        <p>Gobo is instantly recognizable by his distinctive orange fur that covers his entire body. His most unique feature is his tail, which ends in a tuft of purple fur—the only purple element on his otherwise orange appearance. This purple-tipped tail has become iconic among Fraggle Rock fans.</p>

                        <h2>Personality & Character Traits</h2>
                        <p>Gobo's personality is defined by several key traits that make him the natural leader of the Fraggle Five:</p>
                        
                        <div class="traits-grid">
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Brave & Adventurous</h4>
                                <p>Gobo faces dangers that would terrify other Fraggles, from venturing into Outer Space to exploring uncharted caves.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Natural Leader</h4>
                                <p>Without seeking authority, Gobo naturally takes charge when situations require direction, and others instinctively follow.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Curious & Inquisitive</h4>
                                <p>His endless questions about the world drive many adventures and often lead to important discoveries.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Loyal Friend</h4>
                                <p>Despite his leadership role, Gobo never puts himself above his friends and fiercely protects those he loves.</p>

                        <h3>Character Flaws</h3>
                        <p>Like all well-written characters, Gobo has flaws that make him relatable:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stubbornness:</strong> Once Gobo makes up his mind, he can be difficult to dissuade—even when he's wrong</li>
                            <li><strong>Overconfidence:</strong> His bravery sometimes crosses into recklessness</li>
                            <li><strong>Pressure of Expectations:</strong> Gobo sometimes struggles with the weight of being compared to his legendary uncle</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Role in the Show -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Role in Fraggle Rock</h2>
                        <p>Gobo serves multiple narrative functions throughout the series:</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Postcard Retriever</h3>
                        <p>Gobo's most important recurring role is retrieving postcards from <a href="uncle-traveling-matt.html">Uncle Traveling Matt</a>. These postcards arrive through the hole in <a href="doc.html">Doc's</a> workshop wall, requiring Gobo to brave "Outer Space" and avoid the watchful <a href="sprocket.html">Sprocket</a>. This plot device connects the Fraggle world to ours and provides commentary on human society through Matt's hilariously misinterpreted observations.</p>

                        <h3>The Decision Maker</h3>
                        <p>When the Fraggle Five faces challenges, it's usually Gobo who proposes solutions or makes final decisions. While he respects input from <a href="red-fraggle.html">Red</a>, <a href="mokey-fraggle.html">Mokey</a>, <a href="wembley-fraggle.html">Wembley</a>, and <a href="boober-fraggle.html">Boober</a>, the group often looks to him for leadership.</p>

                        <h3>The Explorer</h3>
                        <p>Gobo maps unexplored regions of <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>, discovering new caves, creatures, and wonders. His exploration drive mirrors his uncle's, though Gobo focuses on the Rock itself rather than Outer Space.</p>
