                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Who is Sprocket?</h2>
                        <p>Sprocket is <a href="doc.html">Doc's</a> loyal dog and the unwitting guardian of the gateway between "Outer Space" and <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>. Unlike his oblivious owner, Sprocket KNOWS the Fraggles are real—he's seen <a href="gobo-fraggle.html">Gobo</a> sneaking into the workshop countless times. But no matter how hard he tries to convince Doc, the well-meaning inventor never believes him.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sprocket's character provides both comedy and tension to <em>Fraggle Rock</em>. His frustrated attempts to reveal the Fraggles create ongoing dramatic stakes, while his expressions of exasperation when Doc doesn't believe him are genuinely hilarious. Yet beneath the comedy, Sprocket is a deeply loyal companion whose bond with Doc forms one of the show's most touching relationships.</p>
                        
                        <p>From the Fraggles' perspective, Sprocket is a terrifying obstacle—a massive beast who guards the only entrance to Outer Space. This creates excellent tension whenever Gobo must retrieve <a href="uncle-traveling-matt.html">Uncle Matt's</a> postcards.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Physical Description -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
                        <p>Sprocket is a large, shaggy puppet designed to look like a lovable but somewhat unkempt dog. His expressive face can convey frustration, excitement, suspicion, and affection—remarkable range for a puppet character.</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box sprocket-accent">
                            <h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Physical Characteristics</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Large shaggy dog (breed unspecified)</li>
                                <li><strong>Fur Color:</strong> Brown/tan with shaggier highlights</li>
                                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Large—towering over Fraggles</li>
                                <li><strong>Notable Feature:</strong> Incredibly expressive face and body language</li>
                                <li><strong>Design:</strong> Full-body puppet requiring multiple performers</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h3>Puppet Design</h3>
                        <p>Sprocket was an ambitious puppet design. Unlike the smaller Fraggle puppets, Sprocket required a full-body suit approach combined with puppetry techniques. This allowed him to interact naturally with Gerry Parkes (Doc) while maintaining the expressiveness needed for his comedic role.</p>

                    <!-- Role as Guardian -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Guardian of the Gateway</h2>
                        <p>For the Fraggles, Sprocket represents a major obstacle to exploring Outer Space:</p>
                        
                        <h3>From Gobo's Perspective</h3>
                        <p><a href="gobo-fraggle.html">Gobo</a> must sneak past Sprocket every time he retrieves <a href="uncle-traveling-matt.html">Uncle Matt's</a> postcards. This makes every trip to Outer Space a genuine adventure filled with tension. Sprocket's vigilance means Gobo can never relax—one wrong move and the dog will spot him.</p>

                        <h3>The Chase Dynamic</h3>
                        <p>When Sprocket spots Gobo, the chase is on! These sequences create exciting action moments and demonstrate Gobo's bravery. Over time, both Gobo and Sprocket develop a sort of routine—adversaries who've come to know each other's patterns.</p>

                        <h3>Gradual Evolution</h3>
                        <p>Throughout the series, the relationship between Sprocket and the Fraggles subtly evolves. While never becoming friendly, there are moments of mutual curiosity and even grudging respect.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Relationship with Doc -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Relationship with Doc</h2>
                        <p>The Sprocket-<a href="doc.html">Doc</a> relationship is central to the human world segments:</p>
                        
                        <div class="relationship-highlight">
                            <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> The Communication Gap</h3>
                            <p>Sprocket desperately tries to tell Doc about the Fraggles. He barks, gestures, and points at the hole in the wall. Doc responds with affection but complete misunderstanding: "What is it, boy? Do you want a treat?"</p>
                            
                            <p>This running gag is both hilarious and poignant. Sprocket has discovered something incredible—proof of another civilization—but can't bridge the communication gap with his beloved owner. It's a metaphor for all the times beings fail to truly understand each other, even when they care deeply.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Doc's Trust</h3>
                        <p>Despite not believing Sprocket's Fraggle claims, Doc trusts his dog completely in every other way. Their bond transcends the communication barrier, showing that love doesn't require perfect understanding.</p>

                                <li><strong>Puppet Type:</strong> Full-body character requiring multiple performers</li>
                                <li><strong>Design:</strong> Created to look realistic while remaining expressive</li>
                                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Coordinating with live actor Gerry Parkes</li>
                                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Whitmire also performed Wembley in the same series!</li>

                        <h3>Technical Achievement</h3>
                        <p>Sprocket was technically complex—a large puppet that needed to interact convincingly with a live actor in realistic settings. The puppeteers had to coordinate movements, stay out of frame, and make Sprocket feel like a real dog rather than an obvious puppet.</p>

                        <h2>Sprocket Across Borders</h2>
                        <p>While the human characters varied by country, Sprocket remained constant across all international versions of <em>Fraggle Rock</em>. This made Sprocket one of the show's most universally recognized characters—the loyal dog understood in any language.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the UK version with the Lighthouse Keeper, in the German version, and in other adaptations, Sprocket's scenes remained largely the same, with the same puppet footage used wherever possible. This consistency helped maintain the show's visual identity worldwide.</p>

                    <!-- Sprocket's Legacy -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Sprocket's Legacy</h2>
                        <p>Sprocket represents several important aspects of <em>Fraggle Rock</em>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Communication Theme:</strong> His inability to convey what he knows to Doc mirrors the show's larger themes about understanding between different beings</li>
                            <li><strong>Loyalty:</strong> His devotion to Doc models unconditional love and companionship</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> He never gives up trying to reveal the truth, even when repeatedly dismissed</li>
                            <li><strong>Vindication:</strong> The finale rewards his persistence, showing that truth eventually comes out</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sprocket proves that supporting characters can be just as memorable as leads—his expressive performance and relatable frustration made him a fan favorite.</p>
