                        <h2>Who is Wembley Fraggle?</h2>
                        <p>Wembley Fraggle is the kind-hearted, eternally indecisive member of <a href="../characters.html">the Fraggle Five</a>. His name literally comes from the British slang "wemble" or "wembling," meaning to waffle between choices—and that's exactly what Wembley does. Unable to choose between two ice cream flavors, two friends' requests, or two of anything, Wembley's indecisiveness is both his greatest struggle and, paradoxically, the source of his greatest strength: empathy.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the roommate and best friend of <a href="gobo-fraggle.html">Gobo Fraggle</a>, Wembley provides the emotional support that balances Gobo's adventurous leadership. Where Gobo charges ahead, Wembley worries about everyone involved. Where Gobo makes quick decisions, Wembley considers all perspectives—sometimes too many!</p>
                        
                        <p>Wembley's character teaches viewers that seeing multiple sides of every situation is a gift, not a weakness. His loyalty and genuine care for others make him the emotional heart of <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>.</p>

                    <!-- Physical Description -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
                        <p>Wembley is instantly recognizable by his yellow-green fur and his famous banana tree shirt—one of the only Fraggles who regularly wears clothing. His wide eyes often reflect his internal struggle as he tries to decide between options, and his expressive face shows every emotion he's feeling.</p>
                        
                        <div class="info-box wembley-accent">

                        <h3>The Famous Banana Tree Shirt</h3>
                        <p>Wembley's banana tree shirt has become iconic among Fraggle Rock fans.

                                <h4>Unwaveringly Loyal</h4>
                                <p>Once Wembley commits to a friend, he's loyal forever. His devotion to Gobo and the others is absolute and unshakeable.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">
                                <div class="trait-icon"><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i></div>
                                <h4>Chronically Indecisive</h4>
                                <p>Wembley sees validity in every option, making choices agonizing. "I can't decide!" is practically his catchphrase.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>People Pleaser</h4>
                                <p>Wembley wants everyone to be happy, often at his own expense. He hates conflict and disappointing anyone.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Deeply Empathetic</h4>
                                <p>His indecisiveness stems from seeing all perspectives. This makes him an excellent listener and mediator when he overcomes his anxiety.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h3>Why Can't Wembley Decide?</h3>
                        <p>Wembley's indecisiveness isn't random—it comes from several sources:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Empathy Overload:</strong> He genuinely understands everyone's position, making it hard to choose sides</li>
                            <li><strong>Fear of Disappointment:</strong> He can't bear the thought of letting anyone down</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Self-Confidence:</strong> He doubts his own judgment, trusting others' opinions more than his own</li>
                            <li><strong>Conflict Avoidance:</strong> Making choices often means some kind of conflict, which Wembley avoids</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Throughout the series, Wembley learns that not deciding is itself a decision—often the worst one—and that his perspective is valuable.</p>

                        <h2>Role in Fraggle Rock</h2>
                        
                        <h3>The Volunteer Fire Department</h3>
                        <p>Despite his anxiety, Wembley serves as the siren player for the Fraggle Rock Volunteer Fire Department. This role requires him to spring into action during emergencies—proof that when it truly matters, Wembley can act decisively to help others.</p>

                        <h3>Gobo's Support System</h3>
                        <p>As <a href="gobo-fraggle.html">Gobo's</a> roommate and best friend, Wembley provides essential emotional support. He worries when Gobo goes to Outer Space, celebrates his returns, and offers a sympathetic ear when adventures go wrong. Their friendship is the emotional core of many <a href="../episodes.html">episodes</a>.</p>

                        <h3>The Neutral Party</h3>
                        <p>When the Fraggles disagree, Wembley often ends up in the middle—partly because he can't choose a side, but also because he genuinely understands both perspectives. This makes him valuable in resolving conflicts, once he learns to share his balanced viewpoint.</p>
