                        <h2>Who is Boober Fraggle?</h2>
                        <p>Boober Fraggle is the pessimistic, cautious, and surprisingly talented member of <a href="../characters.html">the Fraggle Five</a>. While the other Fraggles rush off to play, Boober prefers the safety of his cave, the comfort of doing laundry, and the satisfaction of preparing a well-cooked meal. He sees danger everywhere—and he's occasionally right, which only reinforces his worrying.</p>
                        
                        <p>But there's more to Boober than meets the eye. This fearful Fraggle is actually the best cook in all of <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>, creating dishes that bring joy to everyone. He's also hiding a secret: an alter ego named Sidebottom who represents everything Boober suppresses—fun, spontaneity, and reckless abandon.</p>
                        
                        <p>Boober's character explores important themes about anxiety, the value of caution, and how our fears can both protect and limit us. He teaches viewers that it's okay to be scared, and that quiet, careful people have their own kind of bravery.</p>

                        <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
                        <p>Boober's appearance reflects his personality—muted, careful, and a bit disheveled. His blue-green (teal) fur is often covered by his signature oversized cap, which he pulls down over his eyes when stressed. He frequently looks worried, with wide eyes scanning for potential dangers.</p>

                        <h2>Personality & Character Traits</h2>
                        <p>Boober's personality is a complex mix of fear, skill, and hidden depths:</p>

                                <p>Boober sees potential disaster everywhere. Germs, cave-ins, bad luck—if it can go wrong, Boober has already imagined it going wrong.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <p>Boober's greatest passion is doing laundry. The methodical, clean, predictable nature of washing clothes brings him peace.</p>

                        <h3>What Boober Fears</h3>
                        <p>Boober's fears are extensive and specific:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Germs & Illness:</strong> Boober is convinced that sickness lurks everywhere</li>
                            <li><strong>Bad Luck:</strong> He believes in superstitions and omens</li>
                            <li><strong>Adventure:</strong> Any activity outside his routine terrifies him</li>
                            <li><strong>The Unknown:</strong> New things could be dangerous things</li>
                            <li><strong>Losing Control:</strong> He needs predictability and order</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Sidebottom -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Sidebottom: Boober's Alter Ego</h2>
                        <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of Boober's character is <strong>Sidebottom</strong>—his fun-loving, mischievous alter ego who emerges when Boober's repressed desires for fun become too strong to contain.</p>
                        
                        <div class="sidebottom-box">
                            <h3><i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> About Sidebottom</h3>
                            <p>Sidebottom represents everything Boober suppresses:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Loves Fun:</strong> Sidebottom wants to play, dance, and celebrate</li>
                                <li><strong>Reckless:</strong> He ignores all the dangers that obsess Boober</li>
                                <li><strong>Mischievous:</strong> He enjoys pranks and causing harmless chaos</li>
                                <li><strong>Fearless:</strong> Nothing scares Sidebottom—the opposite of Boober</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Sidebottom storylines explore the psychological concept that repressing parts of ourselves doesn't make them disappear—they just find other ways to emerge. Boober must learn to integrate some of Sidebottom's joy into his life without losing his careful nature entirely.</p>

                        <h3>Laundry Excellence</h3>
                        <p>While other Fraggles see laundry as a chore, Boober finds it meditative and fulfilling. His expertise in fabric care is unmatched, and he takes genuine pride in fresh, clean clothes. This running joke also represents how different people find joy in different activities.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Medical Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>Boober's obsession with illness has given him extensive knowledge about Fraggle health and remedies. When someone is actually sick, Boober's expertise becomes genuinely valuable, and his worry transforms into competent care.</p>

                        <h3>The Voice of Caution</h3>
                        <p>When the Fraggle Five rushes into adventure, Boober points out what could go wrong. While often dismissed, he's sometimes right—and even when he's not, his caution prevents the group from being reckless.</p>

                        <p>Through cooking and care, Boober nurtures the Fraggle community in ways that matter. His contributions aren't flashy adventures, but they're essential to daily life in Fraggle Rock.</p>

                        <h2>Why Boober Matters</h2>
                        <p>Boober represents viewers who struggle with anxiety, fear, or feeling different from their more adventurous peers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Validates Caution:</strong> Shows that being careful isn't the same as being weak</li>
                            <li><strong>Hidden Talents:</strong> Demonstrates that quiet people have valuable skills</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety Representation:</strong> One of TV's earliest honest portrayals of anxious personalities</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Boober's message is powerful: you don't have to be brave like Gobo or energetic like Red to matter. Your careful nature and quiet contributions are valuable too.</p>
