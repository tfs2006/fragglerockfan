                        <p>The Architect Doozer holds one of the most prestigious positions in all of <a href="doozers-guide.html">Doozer society</a>. While every Doozer builds, the Architect DESIGNS. He creates the blueprints, plans the structures, and envisions the magnificent towers and constructions that define Doozer civilization.</p>
                        
                        <p>In a society dedicated entirely to building, the Architect represents the pinnacle of achievement—the creative visionary whose designs become reality through the collective effort of thousands of tiny green workers. His position is so respected that young <a href="cotterpin-doozer.html">Cotterpin Doozer</a> dreams of one day becoming an architect herself.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Architect embodies Doozer values: precision, dedication, creativity within structure, and the understanding that great works require both vision and execution. He bridges the gap between imagination and the physical <a href="doozer-constructions.html">Doozer constructions</a> that fill <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>.</p>

                        <p>Even in a society where uniforms are standard, the Architect stands out. His bearing communicates authority and expertise. When he unrolls a blueprint, other Doozers pay attention—this is the moment when their work receives direction and purpose.</p>

                            <h3>What does the Architect Doozer design?</h3>
                            <p>The Architect designs all major Doozer constructions—towers, bridges, domes, roadways, and complex structures made from crystallized radish sticks. His blueprints guide thousands of Doozer workers.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Why is the Architect so respected?</h3>
                            <p>In a society devoted to building, the ability to DESIGN is the highest skill. While all Doozers build, only the Architect creates the visions that others construct. This creative leadership earns tremendous respect.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>How does someone become a Doozer architect?</h3>
                            <p>Traditionally, it requires years of building experience, demonstrated talent, and working through established channels. Cotterpin's desire to become an architect as a young Doozer challenges these conventions.</p>

                            <h3>Does it bother the Architect that Fraggles eat his designs?</h3>
                            <p>Doozers find meaning in building itself, not in permanence. The Architect designs knowing structures will be consumed, but this doesn't diminish the value of the creative process.</p>
