                        <p>Flange Doozer is <a href="cotterpin-doozer.html">Cotterpin Doozer's</a> father and a respected member of <a href="doozers-guide.html">Doozer society</a>. He represents the traditional Doozer values of hard work, dedication, and following established paths—values that sometimes clash with his daughter's unconventional dreams.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a parent, Flange faces the universal challenge of wanting the best for his child while struggling to understand dreams that differ from his own expectations. He loves Cotterpin deeply but worries about her desire to become an <a href="architect-doozer.html">architect</a> and her unusual friendship with a Fraggle.</p>
                        
                        <p>Flange's character arc mirrors that of many parents: learning to support children even when their paths are unexpected. His journey from concern to acceptance shows that love can bridge the gap between tradition and change.</p>

                            <p>Flange doesn't understand why Cotterpin can't be happy with a "normal" Doozer life. Building is honorable work! Why does she need to be an architect? And why—WHY—is she friends with a Fraggle?</p>
                            
                            <p>Yet beneath his confusion, Flange's love never wavers. He might question Cotterpin's choices, but he never questions his love for her.</p>

                            <li><strong>Fraggle Friendship:</strong> The idea of his daughter befriending a creature that eats Doozer buildings is deeply unsettling</li>
                            <li><strong>Social Standing:</strong> He worries about how Cotterpin's unconventional behavior reflects on the family</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Growth and Acceptance</h3>
                        <p>Over time, Flange learns that supporting Cotterpin means accepting her as she is—dreams, Fraggle friends, and all. This growth represents one of the show's most touching parental arcs.</p>

                    <!-- Role in Doozer Society -->
                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Role in Doozer Society</h2>
                        <p>Flange is a respected member of the Doozer community:</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Ideal Doozer Citizen</h3>
                        <p>In many ways, Flange represents the ideal Doozer: hardworking, dedicated, content with his role, and committed to his community. He follows the <a href="architect-doozer.html">Architect's</a> blueprints faithfully and takes pride in every <a href="doozer-constructions.html">construction</a> project.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Community Standing</h3>
                        <p>Flange's standing in Doozer society makes Cotterpin's rebellion more complicated. If he were a marginal figure, her choices might go unnoticed. But as a respected Doozer, his daughter's behavior draws attention.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Social Pressure</h3>
                        <p>Other Doozers notice when Cotterpin acts unconventionally. Flange feels this social pressure—not just for himself, but for his daughter's future in Doozer society.</p>

                        <h3>What Flange Wants for Cotterpin</h3>
                        <p>When Flange imagines Cotterpin's future, he sees her finding the same satisfaction he finds in building. He wants her to experience the joy of construction, the camaraderie of the work crew, and the pride of contributing to Doozer civilization.</p>
                        
                        <p>What he learns is that Cotterpin can find similar satisfaction in designing rather than building—different expression, same dedication.</p>

                            <h3>Why does Flange struggle with Cotterpin's dreams?</h3>
                            <p>Flange genuinely believes the traditional Doozer path leads to happiness. He's not trying to suppress Cotterpin—he's trying to protect her from what he sees as an uncertain, difficult path.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Does Flange ever support Cotterpin?</h3>
                            <p>Yes! Through the series, Flange learns to support Cotterpin's dreams even when he doesn't fully understand them. His love for his daughter ultimately trumps his concerns.</p>

                            <h3>What is Flange's relationship with Wingnut like?</h3>
                            <p>Flange and Wingnut appear to have a supportive partnership. They share concerns about Cotterpin but also work together to navigate the challenges of parenting their unconventional daughter.</p>

                            <p>Like most Doozers, Flange has complex feelings about Fraggles. They eat everything Doozers build! The idea of his daughter befriending one is initially very troubling.</p>
