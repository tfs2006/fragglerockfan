                        <h2>Who is Red Fraggle?</h2>
                        <p>Red Fraggle is the energetic, athletic powerhouse of <a href="../characters.html">the Fraggle Five</a>. Bursting with confidence, competitive spirit, and boundless energy, Red is the ultimate daredevil of <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>. She holds numerous swimming records in the Great Hall pool and approaches every challenge as a competition to be won.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the roommate of the gentle <a href="mokey-fraggle.html">Mokey Fraggle</a>, Red represents one half of the show's most compelling friendship—proving that opposite personalities can not only coexist but strengthen each other. Where Mokey is dreamy and artistic, Red is action-oriented and practical. Their dynamic explores themes of friendship, acceptance, and appreciating different perspectives.</p>
                        
                        <p>Red's character teaches viewers that confidence and physical ability are wonderful traits, but true strength comes from vulnerability, admitting mistakes, and supporting others even when you'd rather be competing.</p>

                        <h3>The Voice of Action</h3>
                        <p>When the Fraggle Five faces a problem, Red's solution is almost always "do something!" She cuts through indecision and endless discussion, pushing the group to take action. While this sometimes causes problems, it also prevents paralysis by analysis.</p>

                        <h3>Comic Relief & Heart</h3>
                        <p>Red's overconfidence and competitiveness create many humorous situations, especially when she has to admit she was wrong. But beneath her bravado lies a loyal friend who would do anything for those she loves.</p>

                        <h3>Teaching Moments</h3>
                        <p>Red's character arc teaches children (and adults) that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Being the best at something doesn't make you better than others as a person</li>
                            <li>Different types of intelligence and skill all have value</li>
                            <li>Winning isn't everything—how you play matters more</li>
                            <li>Strong people can still be vulnerable and ask for help</li>
