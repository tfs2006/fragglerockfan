                        <h2>Who is Mokey Fraggle?</h2>
                        <p>Mokey Fraggle is the gentle, artistic soul of <a href="../characters.html">the Fraggle Five</a>. A poet, painter, and philosopher, Mokey sees beauty in everything around her and expresses herself through various creative outlets. She represents the contemplative, spiritual side of Fraggle culture and often serves as the moral compass of the group.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the roommate of the energetic <a href="red-fraggle.html">Red Fraggle</a>, Mokey demonstrates that opposites not only attract but can form the deepest friendships. While Red rushes through life, Mokey takes time to appreciate each moment. Their dynamic teaches viewers that different approaches to life are equally valid.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mokey has a special connection with Marjory the Trash Heap, the all-knowing oracle of <a href="../universe.html">Fraggle Rock</a>. She frequently visits Marjory for wisdom and guidance, and her spiritual nature makes her particularly receptive to the Trash Heap's sometimes cryptic advice.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
                        <p>Mokey's appearance reflects her gentle, dreamy nature. Her lavender-purple fur is soft and soothing to look at, and her long, flowing mauve hair often falls gracefully over her shoulders. She moves with an almost ethereal grace that matches her contemplative personality.</p>

                        <h2>Personality & Character Traits</h2>
                        <p>Mokey's personality is defined by creativity, spirituality, and deep empathy:</p>
                        
                        <div class="traits-grid">
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Deeply Creative</h4>
                                <p>Mokey expresses herself through painting, poetry, and various art forms. Creativity isn't just her hobby—it's how she processes the world.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Spiritually Connected</h4>
                                <p>More in tune with nature and the spiritual realm than other Fraggles, Mokey seeks wisdom from Marjory and finds meaning in everyday moments.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Gentle & Empathetic</h4>
                                <p>Mokey feels others' emotions deeply and rarely raises her voice. Her gentleness makes her an excellent mediator and confidant.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="trait-card">

                                <h4>Strong Convictions</h4>
                                <p>Despite her gentle nature, Mokey stands firm when she believes something is right. Her quiet strength surprises those who mistake gentleness for weakness.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h3>The Dreamy Side</h3>
                        <p>Mokey's contemplative nature sometimes means she's lost in thought when action is needed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dreaminess:</strong> Mokey can be so absorbed in her thoughts that she misses what's happening around her</li>
                            <li><strong>Idealism:</strong> Her belief in the good of all creatures sometimes blinds her to real dangers</li>
                            <li><strong>Sensitivity:</strong> She takes criticism hard and can be hurt by harsh words</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Role in Fraggle Rock</h2>
                        
                        <h3>The Radish Gatherer</h3>
                        <p>Mokey has the dangerous job of harvesting radishes from the Gorgs' garden to feed the Fraggle community. This requires venturing into Gorg territory, making gentle Mokey surprisingly brave. Her connection to nature helps her navigate the garden and avoid Junior Gorg's attempts to catch "Fwaggles."</p>

                        <h3>Spiritual Guide</h3>
                        <p>When Fraggles need wisdom, Mokey often suggests visiting Marjory the Trash Heap. Her openness to spiritual guidance makes her the natural liaison between the Fraggle community and their oracle. She interprets Marjory's cryptic advice for her more practical-minded friends.</p>

                        <h3>Emotional Support</h3>
                        <p>Mokey is the friend everyone turns to when they need to talk. Her empathy and non-judgmental nature make her the perfect confidant, whether <a href="boober-fraggle.html">Boober</a> is worried about germs or <a href="wembley-fraggle.html">Wembley</a> can't make a decision.</p>
